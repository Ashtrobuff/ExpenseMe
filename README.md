- CoreGraphics, being a low-level API, required manual calculations for point coordinates, geometry paths, and clipping paths.
- Significant effort was put into making the graphs visually appealing and accurate.

## Technologies Used

- **CoreData:** For data storage and management.
- **CoreGraphics:** For creating custom visualizations and graphs.
- **CoreAnimation:** To enhance the visual appeal of graphs and transitions.
